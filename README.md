# Bottle Rocket iOS Project Standards

## Introduction

This document provides Bottle Rocket's point-of-view on several topics regarding iOS application development. Having served the smartphone app market since its inception in 2008, we consider the information here to be a set of "best practices" that we try to apply when building iOS apps.

Although we generally expect our engineers to follow these standards, we recognize that there are many ways to build iOS apps. If you have a differing opinion on how something should be done (employee or not), have additional tips or ideas to share, or see something that seems incorrect, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request to start a conversation. We welcome community discussion and look forward to learning from one another!
